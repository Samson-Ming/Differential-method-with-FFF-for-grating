# Differential-method-with-FFF-for-grating
# RCWA-FFF-with-S-method
Differential method (DM) with Fast Fourier Factorization for 1D surface relief grating. The S matrix method is used. This code is optimzed for overhanging grating.
Note there is still some minor problem with transmission under TE polarization.
